# LAWIS Data Analysis
Welcome to my exploratory data science project on avalanche incidents in Europe! This project aims to retrieve information from LAWIS, an Open Government Data (OGD) database, and create compelling visualizations that provide insights into the occurrences and characteristics of avalanche accidents. 
This project seeks to explore the data and uncover meaningful patterns that can help in understanding the dynamics of avalanches and inform risk management strategies. 

## Motivation
Every year, an average of 100 people lose their lives due to snow avalanches in Europe alone [(1)](https://www.avalanches.org/fatalities/). 
As someone who loves exploring the mountains, I understand the importance of avalanche awareness and education. That's why I've decided to embark on a project to learn new skills and gain insights into this fascinating and all-too-often deadly phenomenon.

The risks of snow avalanches are real, but with the right education and preparation, we can enjoy the beauty of the mountains while staying reasonably safe.

## About LAWIS
> LAWIS is a cross-border portal for sustainable data collection, dissemination and communication of avalanche relevant information. It comprises a freely accessible online avalanche information tool based on public participation, Open Government Data (OGD) and applied research. LAWIS is aimed at the public and is available worldwide. It is currently actively supported by the seven Austrian avalanche warning services and coordinated jointly by the University of Vienna.
